THE PLAN:
    - Create an 8 x 8 board (2D-array)
        - implement a ShowBoard, which nicely depicts the board on console. 
    - Randomly place X bombs (utilise a random num gen % boardSize to position it's x & y co-ords)
    - Each square then determines it's number (number = #bombs in surrounding 8 tiles)
        - The square will have two states: hidden & revealed
    - Users will 'reveal' sqaures
        - If bomb, game ends
        - If number, display number

- COMPLETED ABOVE 21:00 6/1/23
            - Reveal any surrounding squares with a num. of 0 (recursive)
    - User wins if #remaining-squares = #bombs 
        - Could also implement a system where the user may mark bombs (i.e. m 1,2)
